    <h2 class="text-center">The Everlasting Scars</h2>
    
    <p class="m-4">
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  It was a blazing hot noon in Thailand. Fourteen-year-old Li Jun was sitting alone at the school’s football stadium, gazing his eyeballs towards the dancing cheerleaders covered in sweat. Those girls were practicing for the school’s upcoming sports festival. They all wore black sports bras with short skirts for convenience during practice. Li Jun was simply eating lunch. With a spoon in his hands, he shoved it into the lunch box containing cold fried rice, eyes still focusing on the high school girls who are slightly older than him. He then moved his arms up to put the spoon into his mouth, just to taste nothing. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; “ah...The rice fell”, he said lifelessly as he removed his gaze from them to the rice that fell onto his feet.  <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li Jun was thinner and shorter than average boys his age. He had ebony straight black hair with dark gray eyes, the typical look that could be found anywhere in Asia. His eyes were considered large compared to other Chinese people, they were almond-shaped and looked deeply mesmerizing. Each of his gazes was watchful like it could pierce someone’s skin; however, they looked drowsy and tired at the same time. His hair was almost fully shaved; he had the ‘Thai student’ haircut that no one liked. His skin was slightly tanned, but it didn’t look like it was sunburnt. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Suddenly, he heard multiple, loud footsteps that were undesirably familiar to him. They were the reason he was here in the first place. Before he could even do anything, four boys, the same age as him, stood in front of his face and blocked all of the paths that he could escape. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Were you thinking of running away from us, you made-in-China nerd? Heh, how foolish of you to think you can escape.” The guy standing on Li Jun’s left said while leaning his face towards him. He’s one of the four bullies that kept chasing him. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;These kids were looking for a target to bully ever since they started middle school, so when Li Jun joined this school, they hassled him right off the bat. Li Jun was Chinese, adopted, and undernourished; he was the perfect target. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jun wasn’t the easiest person to deal with, though. He never showed any kind of fear towards anyone, he’s good with his mouth, and also gave the bullies trouble a few times. However, this only made the urge to oppress Jun increase for the four boys.  <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“For god’s sake, what do you want?” He said in his usual monotonous tone and closed the lid of his lunchbox to stare at them coldly like he always did.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The large figure in front of him turned his head back to the football court with dancing cheerleaders in revealing clothes and chuckled, “Well well well, what do I see here? Is this Chinese freak a perverted big boy now?” He moved his head towards Jun.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t you know they don’t allow students to come up here?” One guy pointed at the sign written at the corner of the court, “You broke the rules to peek at those hot chicks didn’t cha’, little pervert, I bet God will be angry if he knows you broke a rule.” He then grabbed his thin and frail wrist that didn’t seem to have any muscle in it. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“I’m not a pervert. I can be here because my sister and her friends allowed me here, so I did absolutely nothing wrong.” Jun sturdily claimed.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t freakin’ lie, Junussy, do you think we are idiots? There is no way P’Chon is your sibling. The prettiest school-star like her would never want to adopt you as her brother.” He squeezed his tiny wrist harder like he was going to snap it, and derided. Jun didn’t show it on his face, but it extremely hurts. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“I mean, P’Chon is nice and kind-hearted. She would’ve obviously helped a poor hungry boy like hi-” A guy on the right spoke up, but shutted his mouth after the largest guys in the middle, or the boss, glared at him, frowning. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Can I go now? The class is starting soon.” <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“What’s the hurry, Junnussy? There’s still 15 minutes left, that’s a lot of time for us to play together~” The guy kept twisting his wrist harder and harder so that the pain was almost unbearable.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Stop it. You’re gonna get in real trouble if you don’t stop.” Jun kept his voice steady and deep while trying to make an excuse to get out of here as soon as possible -- his wrist might have broken if this continues. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Awwww, bleh. Look at this little good-for-nothing Junnussy. You think we are scared just because you try to look intimidating? No wonder why your parents left you, you’re just a loser. Getting raised by the slut P’Chon probably made you like this.” He turned his head back towards the football court to look at the cheerleaders with a snicker. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jun finally snapped, despite his ignorant expression, he was so over with all of this BS that he endured for almost three years. “You jackasses. How dare you talk about my sister like that, God will never forgive you for this sin.” With his heart beating like it was popping out of his chest, he said that, sweating heavily with a calm voice. Jun thought of his pride highly, and always reminded himself to look strong in front of other people. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Pffffffft HAHAHAHAHA- What did you call us again? Jackasses? You absolute FREAK. Who do you think you are, huh?!” The boss then threw him off his chair by swinging his wrist, causing Jun’s face to land on another chair’s hard backrest on the bottom row. The football stadium’s slope was high, and he was sitting on the very top row, so it was a hard hit on the nose. They all cackled while looking down at Li Jun who was glancing at all of them like an angry cat. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Gravity truly did its work. The intense pain on Jun’s nose bridge was almost unbearable, it felt like his bone there shattered entirely. His eyes became red and tears were running from the inside, but he tried to hold it in. He'd rather die than cry pathetically in front of those bastards. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The four bullies bursted out laughing after seeing Jun’s pathetic holding-tears expression. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jun sat up and touched his nose to check if it was still okay, and felt liquid running everywhere. On his hands, on his face, his school uniform, to the chair, all the way to the floor. It was bleeding heavily from his nose bridge. 

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“And yes, you are indeed bleeding all over your face. What should we do if it dies~? Let’s hide the body somewhere~” <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“What, Junnussy, are you gonna cry? C’mon, let all of your feelings out and stop acting tough, we want to see your pathetic crying face! It’s going to be even more pathetic with the blood!”<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Immense rage kicked in. It was unfair. Why was he treated like this? He thought he could hold it in, but he really couldn’t anymore.  “Ha…! Aren’t you the real good-for-nothings here? You f*cking DESTROYED me for just some freaking attention from other people. You guys are the real pathetic losers here. Tch.” He said as he covered his bleeding nose bridge with his hands, trying not to lose too much blood. He would never accept death if someone like these guys murdered him. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“HOW DARE YOU-” The bullies’ faces were also filled with rage. They then jumped down to the row Li Jun was sitting in,<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;They’re definitely going to kill me if they catch me again, Jun thought. He instantly sat up and ran to somewhere else as fast as possible. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“That toy!!! -- Stop running away!”<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The guys chased after him, and it seemed like there was hope that he could escape. However, Jun suddenly felt dizzy from the loss of blood. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‘Oh god NOT RIGHT NOW’ Jun screamed in his head as he tripped his own leg and fell down to his knees. If the bullies catch him, he will die, or at least get severely injured. His heart pounded like drums, his eyes widened and shacked out of terror, all hairs on his body stood on their ends, he gripped his palm, praying. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;‘God please save me!’<br><br>

  …..</p><br><br>
      <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Get away from him right now!” A high-pitched and breathy, yet angelic voice yelled from behind him. It was a very familiar voice for Li Jun. He immediately looked back to see a 15-year-old tall girl with black and thick braided hair, covered in sweat from the practice. She already changed her clothes to the student uniform: white shirt and blue skirt. Her face was bright and gentle, there was no acne to be found. Her eyelashes on her bright eyes were long and perfectly curved, and her lips were glossy. She had the perfect yellow skin with pink cheeks from make-up (even though it was against the school rules).<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“P’Chon!” His world suddenly brightened once again. He slowly smiled with relief and crawled behind his sister’s back. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Little Li, you poor thing, you are bleeding so much! I’ll call the ambulance right away.” She stroked his hair pitifully and hugged him despite being covered in blood, causing her uniform to be dirtied too. She then picked up her phone and called the ambulance right away. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Sister…” He said in a very shaky and weak voice, like he’s going to cry.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Shhh, it’s alright now, Little Li. I will protect you, so don’t worry, okay?”<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He slowly nodded in response

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Let’s take you to the nurse’s office meanwhile,” Chon then carried her little brother on her back. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Oi! Don’t ignore us like this, P’Chon. We and Junnussy still have things to clear up!” The boss shouted from behind. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Little child,” She smiled, “know your place. Scram and never mess with my brother ever again.” She said menacingly and then walked away.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“WAIT! UGH! How dare she! We’ll kill her…both of them! These freaks have to pay for this!!” <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“The decision of killing someone is the work of Lord Hesperiidae, not you lowly kids. ” A deep, gravelly calm voice spoke up. The boys turned back to see a tall figure staring at them with furrowed, thick brows. The man had short black hair, with round, big eyes and . His skin was smooth and pale like a vampire, and his red, juicy lips made his face look deeply hypnotizing. Overall, he looked as handsome as any korean idol. If the school allowed him to grow his hair longer, he would have been a star by now. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“S-sh*t! It’s freaking P’Non!” One of the bullies shouted and ran away by himself in scaredness.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The others trembled in fear. Non was a popular 16-years-old student, he had amazing looks, but his reputation actually came from his abilities. He was the captain of the school’s Judo team, and a talented sportsman. Everyone in the school could agree that he was the idol for both males and females.  <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But most importantly, he’s P’Chon’s boyfriend.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Don’t go near Chon or Jun ever again. Otherwise, Lord Hesperiidae will definitely have vengeance. You dared to hurt his believers.” He said in a cold and authoritative tone, crossing his arms and looking down at the group of kids that were small like chipmunks compared to him. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Y-yes, P’Non. We are s- s- sorry,”<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;No one dared to defy him, of course. Apart from being popular for his looks and talents, he was also violent. There was a story told that he beated up a big group of gangsters that taunted Chon all by himself, which made people fear him and admire him at the same time. <br><br>
        
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Go say that to my girlfriend and Jun. And if I hear a story like this again, you’re dead.” He moved his thumb across his neck, doing the throat-slitting gesture, and walked away.  <br><br>

        -------------------------------------------9,300,000,000-----------------------------------------------

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And you may be wondering, how did Li Jun get to this country? How did he, who was born in China, came to Thailand in the first place?<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a devastating story. <br><br>

        [ShangHai, year 21XX]<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A boy named Li Jun was born in a small village, he had bright skin and shiny eyes, an absolute precious munchkin. Even though he wasn’t rich, he had a caring pa and ma that loved him more than anything. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One day, when the boy was only 3 years old, his parents diligently collected money from farming rice to go travel to Thailand together. Small Li Jun was only three, but he clearly remembered the excitement he felt when the plane took off. The plane was very big from Jun’s view, and he was humming along the way, excited to go traveling for the first time. In a few moments, he fell asleep in his ma’s arms. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After a few hours, he was awakened by the immense heat. And the sound of people screaming. And the violent vibration of the plane.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Small Li Jun was only three, but he clearly remembered the terror he felt when the plane was accelerating down with an enormous speed, the blazing flame around him, and the dread on everyone’s faces.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“We are about to make an unscheduled landing because of a problem in about two minutes. Please wear the oxygen mask and the life jacket provided. Thank you.”<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Everybody on the plane at this point went crazy. Some were screaming for their life whose body was consumed by the flame, some were begging their god to save them, and some were crying miserably knowing that this moment would be the last of their life. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He could remember his pa putting the oxygen mask for him, and carried him and his ma to the back of the plane and walked away.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Honey, stay here and protect our little Li, alright?” Pa said with a hurried voice, and ran toward the front of the plane, where there was the most fire. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“No, my love, where are you going! Come back here right now!!” Ma’s voice followed him as he went on to save a child in the fire. His pa’s back was the last thing Jun saw, before the smoke blocked his sight and that was the last time he saw his pa alive. <br><br>

        <b>BOOM</b><br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The plane crashed into the ground. Small Li Jun heard explosions and flames getting stronger every second. His skin felt like they were boiling and melting and his face just crashed with a hard object. People that used to scream and cried stopped screaming, and turned into burnt ashes.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li Jun was too young to understand. All that was in his mind was genuine questions: What is happening? Why is his ma crying and hugging him? Why is his pa not breathing anymore?<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The shock that was hitting him and questions inside his head prevented him from moving, or even to process anything. He only could remember was the last warmth he received from his ma, and her voice saying:<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Little Li, there is no such thing as accidents in this world. Everything is the consequence of our sin; and God's job is to decide everything. It is his job to punish our sinful self.” She hugged him tighter and closer to her heart, that seemed to be beating slower and slower every second as the coughs. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“O’God, protect him.”<br><br> 

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jun turned to his ma, who was still holding him, to find that her heart had stopped. The pain he received from the flame and the crash was nothing compared to the shock in his mind. Poor Li Jun paused for a whole minute, and his instinct finally kicked in. It took a while for the realization to hit him that everyone else had already died. <br><br>
          
        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Li Jun was not entirely uninjured, his skin was burnt black and red, and the crash left a scar across his left cheek. It was also very difficult for him to move; his leg was broken and full of scars. He slowly moved off his mom’s corpse, found his dead dad, prayed, and continued walking forward to the unknown world. <br><br>

        -------------------------------------------9,400,000,000-----------------------------------------------

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The poor boy roamed around Thailand to find food and shelter. A few years later, he finally got adopted by his new, loving family. They lived in the rural area of Thailand. They were not very rich, but they could provide him the most fulfilling life he could ever ask for.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jun looked up to his sister, who was like a perfect angel to him. P’Chon was immaculate, impeccable and incorrupt. She always had hair tied properly into a nice and high ponytail. She never forgot to wear a blue ribbon in her hair (that was the school dress-code), and despite her poor financial status, she always wore the most clean and tidy uniform. She was the best sister, best dancer, best student, and genuinely nice to everyone. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He loved his gullible sister. <br><br>

        .

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Oh my poor Little Li! You’ve finally awakened, sis was so worried about you!” Chon opened her hands wide and pulled Li Jun into a soft and warm, yet gentle embrace. Jun was confused where he was. Everything seemed so bright to him, it seemed like he was asleep for quite a long time. He looked around the room that was cool and clean. The air smelled like herbs, which made him really calm. Below him was a narrow hospital bed, with P’ Chon on her knee beside it, looking very worn-out. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Jun suddenly felt pain, a similar feeling he had eleven years ago. He gradually used his entire palm to touch his face, where he felt a deep, old scar on his cheek (which he got from the plane crash), and a plump bandage on his nose. Jun immediately remembered everything, the bullies, the blood, the ambulance and how P’ Chon saved him. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Thank you, P’ Chon. If it wasn’t for you, I would’ve been dead.” Jun smiled tenderly with tears that felt like it came directly from his heart. It was tears of relief and gratitude to have someone who loved him this much beside him right now. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Little Li… I’m sorry, I should've noticed you sooner. Look, now, Little Li, you are merely fourteen-years-old, yet you have two deep scars on your face like an experienced mercenary! Oh my poor little brother” P’ Chon, who seemed like she was already crying, bawled her eyes out and hugged Li Jun so tight that he could feel the pain from her heartbeat. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“You don’t have to be sorry, P’ Chon. It’s my fault I couldn’t take care of myself. Where is mom and dad?”<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Mom and dad were so worried about you, but now they’re off to work. Anyhow, sis was also very worried, and P’ Non was also worried, he already taught the bullies a lesson!” P’ Chon cried harder, to the point that Jun had to console her. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But there was one thing that bugged Li Jun.<br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“Isn’t it midnight? Why is mom and dad working?” Jun asked. <br><br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“...I guess our business isn’t very good lately, so they have to work overtime. Sigh… You don’t have to worry about that, though! Everything will return back to normal sooner or later!” P’ Chon replied with a shaky voice, still trying to hold in her tears.<br><br>
